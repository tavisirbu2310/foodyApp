This app was built using React and React Hooks for functional components. The styling was done with CSS modules.

The user can enter a food name in the search bar and this will return a list of recipes based on the searched word or nothing if the word the user is looking for is not in the database.

If the food is in the databse, then the user can choose to click one of the returned recipes and more information will be fetched from the server about the clicked recipe. The user can interact with the new returned recipe section, so food can be added to a favorites list and the recipe can be changed to serve more or less people, in which case the list of ingredients updates as the user incresease or decreases the number of servings. There's also a button that, when clicked, adds all the ingredients of that recipe to a shopping list that afterwards can be updated by the user(ingredients can be deleted, other ingredients from other recipes can be added). Last but not least, there is a button that takes the user to the source page of the recipe where more information about that particular recipe can be found.

1.Clone

2.Run npm install
